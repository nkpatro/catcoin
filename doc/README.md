SCPFoundation Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
SCPFoundation Core is the original SCPFoundation client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of SCPFoundation transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download SCPFoundation Core, visit [scpfoundation.org](https://scpfoundation.org).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run SCPFoundation on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/scpfoundation-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/scpfoundationd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run scpfoundation-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag SCPFoundation-Core to your applications folder, and then run SCPFoundation-Core.
